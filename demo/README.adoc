= Antlr4 GWT Simple Demo Project

This little sample is here to demonstrate how to include the Antlr4-GWT library in your GWT project.

== How to run the example

In the `demo` folder, simply do:

	$ mvn package gwt:run

Once the jetty server is started, go to:

    http://127.0.0.1:8888/SimpleDemo.html


== Import the code in Eclipse

Go to `File -> Import... -> Existing Maven Project`, then select the `demo` location and press `finish`.

[NOTE] 
If you want to modify the grammar and generate again the parser/lexer, you will need the Antlr4.4 Desktop version.
